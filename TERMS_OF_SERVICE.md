# Sweeftcom Terms of Service (India)

**Last Updated:** January 22, 2026

Welcome to Sweeftcom. These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of the Sweeftcom mobile application and website (the "Platform"). By using our Platform, you agree to these Terms.

## 1. The Aggregator Model
Sweeftcom is a technology platform that connects customers with local vendors and independent delivery partners. Sweeftcom does not own, manufacture, or store any products. We act strictly as an aggregator.

## 2. FSSAI Compliance
*   **Vendors:** All food-related vendors listed on Sweeftcom are required to hold a valid FSSAI license.
*   **Complaints:** In case of quality issues with food items, the responsibility lies solely with the Vendor. Sweeftcom will facilitate the communication but is not liable for health issues or quality variances.

## 3. Pricing and Payments
*   **Dynamic Pricing:** Delivery fees may change based on weather (Rain), time (Late Night), and high demand zones.
*   **Sweeftcom Plus:** Subscriptions provide free delivery for eligible orders. Fees are non-refundable once the plan is activated.
*   **GST:** All prices shown are inclusive of applicable GST unless stated otherwise.

## 4. Cancellation and Refunds
*   **Cancellation:** Orders cannot be cancelled once they are "Accepted" by the vendor.
*   **Refunds:** For failed deliveries or missing items, refunds will be processed to the original payment method within 5-7 business days or credited to the Sweeftcom Wallet immediately.

## 5. Security Handshake (OTP)
To complete a delivery, the Customer must provide a 4-digit OTP to the Rider. Providing the OTP signifies the "Transfer of Possession" and confirms that the order has been received in good condition.

## 6. Limitation of Liability
To the maximum extent permitted by Indian law, Sweeftcom shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, or consequential damages resulting from the use of the platform. Our total liability for any claim shall not exceed the order value of the transaction in question.

## 7. Governing Law
These Terms are governed by the laws of India. Any disputes shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts in Aurangabad, Maharashtra.
