# Sweeftcom Pilot Phase: "Zero-Mistake" Training Kit

Welcome to the Sweeftcom Pilot. This guide ensures smooth operations in **Nirala Bazar** and **CIDCO**.

---

## 🛵 For Riders (Logistics Partners)

### 1. Secure Handshake (The 4-Digit OTP)
- **Rule:** You **CANNOT** leave an order without entering the Customer's 4-digit OTP.
- **Process:** Arrive at Customer → Ask for OTP → Enter in "Verify & Complete" field → App unlocks the "Delivered" status.
- **Problem?** If the Customer is not picking up, use the **Live Chat** bridge to send a message.

### 2. Location & Syncing
- **Signal Shadow Zones:** If your 4G drops in CIDCO N-Series, don't worry. The app will save your GPS pings and sync them automatically once you reach a better zone.
- **Geofencing:** As you reach within 100m of Nirala Bazar Dark Store, your status will auto-switch to "At Store."

### 3. Earnings
- Go to the **Earnings** tab to see your daily pilot balance. Performance is calculated based on your speed vs. the 15-minute SLA.

## 🏪 For Vendors (Store Partners)

### 1. Order Buffer & SLA
- **Golden Rule:** You have **60 seconds** to click "Accept" once the loud ringing starts.
- **Escalation:** If ignored, a secondary "Urgent" alert will play, and the Admin will be notified of the latency.

### 2. Inventory Management
- During a rush, if a product (e.g., Mother Dairy Milk) runs out, go to **Live Inventory** and toggle it to **OFF**.
- This immediately removes the item from the Customer app to prevent cancellations.

### 3. Low Stock Alerts
- Keep an eye on the **Orange Warning** labels in your inventory. These appear when stock is below your safety threshold.

## 🛡️ Support & Emergencies
- **SOS:** If the app crashes or stock is incorrectly deducted, call the **Operation Command Center** immediately via the Admin Hotline.
